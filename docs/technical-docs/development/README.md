# Development Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive information about Picura MD's development processes, practices, and tools. These documents serve as guides for developers contributing to the project, ensuring consistent quality and adherence to the project's sustainability principles.

## Overview

The development documentation is structured to provide clear guidance on various aspects of contributing to Picura MD:

- **[Setup Environment](setup-environment.md)**: Instructions for creating a proper development environment
- **[Coding Standards](coding-standards.md)**: Guidelines for code style, formatting, and best practices
- **[Build Process](build-process.md)**: Overview of build scripts, configurations, and optimizations
- **[Testing Framework](testing-framework.md)**: Guide to unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches
- **[CI/CD Pipeline](ci-cd-pipeline.md)**: Explanation of continuous integration and deployment workflow
- **[Performance Profiling](performance-profiling.md)**: Tools and techniques for monitoring and optimizing performance
- **[Sustainability Testing](sustainability-testing.md)**: Methodologies for measuring and improving resource efficiency

## Development Philosophy

Picura MD's development philosophy emphasizes:

1. **Sustainability by Design**: Resource efficiency is not an afterthought but a core design principle
2. **Code Quality**: Maintainable, testable, and documented code that reduces technical debt
3. **User-Centric Development**: Features are developed based on user needs and feedback
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works in all environments, with advanced features available when resources permit
5. **Accessibility**: Inclusive design that works for users with diverse needs and abilities

## Getting Started

New developers should follow this sequence to get up to speed:

1. Review the [architecture documentation](../architecture/README.md) to understand the system design
2. Set up the development environment using the [setup guide](setup-environment.md)
3. Familiarize yourself with the [coding standards](coding-standards.md)
4. Run through the build process and execute tests to verify your setup

## Contributing

Before submitting code, ensure that:

- Your changes comply with the [coding standards](coding-standards.md)
- You've added appropriate tests following the [testing guidelines](testing-framework.md)
- Your code passes all existing tests and the [sustainability benchmarks](sustainability-testing.md)
- You've documented any new APIs or significant changes

All contributions go through code review, automated testing, and sustainability evaluation before being merged.
